    "### Context\n",
    "As a person pursuing the field of data analytics (not science), I don't have much experience building machine learning model, so I took this opportunity to further hone my skills. I learned a lot about tree-based algorithms and mitigating overfitting, which are common issues faced in this field. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed it!\n",

    "**Note to person reading**:\n",
    "As of the time of this writing, it is currently 5:11 AM (5 hours past the deadline and I am about to submit) and I spent the past 9 hours straight coding this project. The reason I spent the extra 5 hours is because technically, I finished the model 30 min before the deadline, but I didn't do the actual predicting on test.csv, which I thought would take 5 minutes (not 5 hours). I worked until the coffee shop closed at 12 and I had to worked on it at a hospital lobby until 2am for me to charge my laptop. Then, on my way back home, on the TTC subway on a friday night, I was still working non-stop and kept working a couple hours more when I got home. I quite frankly thought of giving up at least 30 times, but something inside me kept pushing me to keep going. And because of my relentless perserverence, this was probably the most cruel, yet rewarding project I did so far. So, as much as I understand that I missed the deadline, it would be greatly appreciated if it can still be considered in the competition. Thanks!\n",

We see that for CAN, 99.25% are churns and 79.8% of NaNs are churns. This means that each value of 'country code has a differing effect on churn. Hence, this feature has predictive power & we'll keep this column. Let's apply this to the remaining near-constant columns."
